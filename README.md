# Realtime Chat App

This is a real-time chat application built using Flutter with the following features:

## Features
- **Login & Register**
- **Realtime Chatting**
- **Status Updates**
- **Contacts Management** (Add & Remove Contacts)
- **Voice & Video Calls** (Integrated with ZegoCloud)

## Project Status
This project was originally started as a practice project when I was learning Firebase. Over time, I learned everything about Firebase and completed the UI along with the implemented features mentioned above. However, I didn't work further on adding new features.

Maybe in the future, I will continue working on this project. ðŸ˜Š
